# J-log's-server
Server side of J-log

This is the server of J-log 

**Usage**:

```
1.cd yourwork directory && git clone

2.npm install && npm start

3. now the server is running;

```
In order to start the server successfully, you need to download [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) first;

And use your command or bash to `mkdir data` inside that file;

Then `cd bin ` type `mongod --dbpath x:/yourdirectory/data` 

Now you see the data base is running, you can go back to the server directory && `npm start` 

Maybe there still has some kind of misunderstanding. Leave me message if you want. 

Do pardon me for not being a better one of coding, I'm on that way & trying.
